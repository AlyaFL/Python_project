# Game console application
For your attention there are new console application for simulating the game. 
## Description
The participants are two characters that you can create yourself. The sequence of moves is determined
randomly. Each of the players has their own level
health (by default it is 100) and choosing the following from the steps:
 - moderate damage with a small range
 - strong damage with a large range
 - small range healing
After each action, a message is printed that informs
what happened and how much health the players have. When the health of the second character
reaches 35 and less he heals. 
## How to use
After launch, the user is prompted to enter a name, health level and damage range. If the user tries to enter a string instead of a number (health and damage level), then a request will appear to enter the data again.

The next step...
There is a question after which the game will start or the project will end (you need to enter yes or no)

P.S. There could be an example of how the main part of the game works, but let it be intriguing. Just run the file <a href="https://github.com/AlyaFL/Python_project/blob/main/game.py"> game.py</a> 
## Content 
The project contains a module (<a href="https://github.com/AlyaFL/Python_project/blob/main/sprite.py"> sprite.py</a>) in which a class is created and a main file (<a href="https://github.com/AlyaFL/Python_project/blob/main/game.py"> game.py</a> ) in which characters are created and the game begins.
